Learning web development is a long path and you never really stop learning! But there are some really great resources to learn practical web development. To take you from having no skills to being employable.

From my personal experience I have learn so much from Team treehouse about so many areas of web development. They are great for beginners or more intermediate developers who are trying to approach a new technology.

The format in which treehouse delivers their content is in video, quizs and coding challenges which really helps reinforce concepts. I would also watch tutorials on my home from work on the train of even have them running in the background while I am coding. Its amazing what you remember even when listen passively.

They structure their content in a way so you know where to go next in their learning paths. If you want to learn all about Android development then you can take their Android path you will be guide through all the basic concepts and build a real working app. As you progress through stages you learn badges so for those gamers who love unlocking trophies this helps it feel more like gaming than learning!

Treehouse isn't the end all or be all but they are one of the best places to begin and build your skill set into the area of web you are wanting to go into but once you reach that intermediate level you are able to then advance more through more in depth study.

For those more intermediate developers I would suggest

- Find the BOOK in your field O'Reily have really wonderful books and if you ever see online there is generally a book which is THE BOOK you need to read to take you knowledge up to the next level
- Read the SOURCE Luke! Whatever framework or language you use chances are there is a open repo on github fork down a copy or explore the latest master branch to see what is going on behind the scenes.
- Get involved with the community! Probably the most important point find a meetup, listen to podcasts and hang out on websites where you get to meet others in the community where you can learn and maybe even help other to learn!
