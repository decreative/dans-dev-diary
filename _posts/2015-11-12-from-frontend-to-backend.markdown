Well its my first post for 2016 it has been a crazy year one in which my experience as a web developer has changed dramatically. When I first started out I was afraid of what happened behind the scenes and to scared to even open the terminal. Now everyday I am using git in the terminal, deploying web services into the cloud, getting deeper knowledge of web infrastructure and seeing how backend and frontend connects together to make an app work.

Would I say I am an expert backend dev? NO WAY! But nor am I scared to get my hands dirty with the backend anymore. I think good frontend developers can master their skills but you can become a GREAT frontend if you make the effort to just get a basic understanding of backend development your frontend way of thinking changes.

You become more aware of backend performance, where the data is coming from, what stack is set up, what infrastructure the app is using. I know all this may seem overwhelming but it is actually quite the opposite is ENLIGHTENING. You appreciate what the connection between the two fields and you reach a level of harmony in how you see an app operate.

Both fields are needed in order to work with each other and no one person can become a true expert in both but having the attitude to learn what your fellow developers do on day to day basis will not only open your mind to their way of thinking but also will make your development more fulfilling!

So with that in mind GO FORTH AND DEVELOP!
