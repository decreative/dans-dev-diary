For anyone who has ever seen a Japanese website knows how horrible and behind the times web design in general is in Japan. Being a frontend developer living here who obsesses over UI / UX design it makes me cry when I see what it being produced.

You don't have to go far to see what I mean take for example [nico nico douga](http://www.nicovideo.jp/) essentially the Japanese equal to Youtube the interface is no where near user friendly.

What you will see generally see in Japanese websites

- Small Low Res images
- Large Amounts of text
- Usually a 2 or 3 column design
- Unresponsive elements
- Table like layouts for forms

While I do complain about the general state of things for UX and UI there is a company here in Tokyo that is doing it in the right way.

**[GoodPatch](http://goodpatch.com/){:target="_blank"}** are a Tokyo based UI Agency that have produced some of the most UI friendly web services in Japan. If you are curious to see what its like when eastern design and modern web practices are combined together I highly recommend you check these guys out as they have produced some of the nicest UI ever seen in Japan.

So the future for web design in Tokyo is looking a little bright looking forward to seeing what will happen over the next couple of years.
