# Prototying Apps with Prott
During the process of brainstorming ideas for an app whether you are working on a personal project or a app for a client. Having a quick prototyping tool lets you hit the ground running, I have used heaps of prototyping tools in the past couple of years. One of the biggest things I still enjoy doing it being able to draw my mockups on paper but paper has it limits.

I recently came across a awesome app called [Prott](http://goodpatch.com/) developed by a UI Shop based out of Tokyo [Goodpatch](http://goodpatch.com/) that allows you to take your designs that you draw on paper and convert them into a digital prototype.

## My Prototyping process
Normally when approaching a new app there are two main scenarios either I am developing an app for myself (YAY fun) or I am making something cool with a team / client. Before even writing one line of code we / I start brainstorming ideas once the basic vision of the app has be defined. From there its paper and pencil writing drawing out the flow of the app.

Ideas for design, functionality and some creative hacking will normally produce a very rough but understandable layout. From here I take my snapshots with Prott and then convert them into digital views then I add the interactive areas. I then have a working prototype to work from I can put it on my iPhone or device to get a feel for how the app could be.

It is amazingly simple and for a team / client it lets you get feedback, iterate and be really agile in your approach to developing the app. If your not using Prott I suggest you really [check it out!](https://prottapp.com/app/)
