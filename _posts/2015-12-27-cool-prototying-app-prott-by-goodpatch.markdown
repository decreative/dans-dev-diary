# Prototying Apps with Prott
During the process of brainstorming ideas for an app whether you are working on a personal project or a app for a client. Having a quick prototyping tool lets you hit the ground running, I have used heaps of prototyping tools in the past couple of years. One of the biggest things I still enjoy doing it being able to draw my mockups on paper but paper has it limits.

I recently came across a awesome app called [Prott](http://goodpatch.com/) developed by a UI Shop based out of Tokyo [Goodpatch](http://goodpatch.com/) that allows you to take your designs that you draw on paper and convert them into a digital prototype.
