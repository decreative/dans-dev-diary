I'm a web developer who originally began out as a music producer I started making band websites 4 years ago for friends. Little did I know it would start me down the path of web development. After discovering how much I loved making websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript I enrolled myself into an intense web bootcamp at a local collage.


I also further augmented my learning by signing up for [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com){:target="_blank"} where I got a solid grasp on the newer technologies being used in web like CSS preprocessors, Javascript task managers and many other build tools.


During the bootcamp I was able to successfully land a job as a junior frontend at a digital web agency [Big Blue Digital](http://bigblue.digital){:target="_blank"} where I got to work in a team of web developers, got to geek out and expand my skills in frontend development. I spend two years at Big Blue Digital then decided to move onto a new challenge that would push me right outside my comfort zone.


I decided to move to Tokyo, Japan and involve myself in the startup community, I arrived in Tokyo in January 2015, taught myself how to speak Japanese and landed a job with a Japanese Web App company [Zigexn](http://zigexn.co.jp/){:target="_blank"} in February 2015.

Since then my world has changed I got exposure to Ruby on Rails, iOS Developerment, Linux, Servers and Cloud Computing. During my time in Tokyo I have also been able to get involved with some startups projects.

Recently in my free time I have been helping a startup called [morei](http://morei.co/){:target="_blank"} they create projects like [Sweet Swift](http://sweetswift.me/){:target="_blank"} that encourages girls to learn programing and enter the web industry in Japan.

I also have started a small production shop called deCreative where I do things like music production, video editing and web development mainly on personal and freelance projects.

***Right now I am looking for a new opportunity to join a team and build something really cool! If you feel you have a project or know of a startup / company who needs a strong frontend dev who isn't afraid of backend black magic drop me a line!***

Think we could work together?
